/**
 * The drift demo switch — opt-in, off by default, and never left on.
 *
 * Recovery is only demonstrable against a page that has actually changed, and
 * the honest change is the ordinary one: somebody renames a `data-testid` while
 * the button itself — its role, its label, its position — stays exactly as it
 * was. That is the case a recorded binding's fallback chain can still explain,
 * and the case Orbit proposes a repair for.
 *
 * Driven by a query parameter rather than a build flag or an edit to revert, so
 * the portal in this repository is never a drifted portal. `?drift=1` renames
 * one test id for that page load; every other visitor, and every existing test,
 * sees the page unchanged. There is nothing to undo afterwards.
 *
 * A run reaches it the same way a person does: an agent whose navigate step
 * targets `/catalog?drift=1` will find the renamed element, because the URL is
 * part of what was recorded.
